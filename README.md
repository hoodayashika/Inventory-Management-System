# Inventory-Management-System
Basic GUI and basic CRUD operations within a graphical interface using Swing.

This project is a Java Swing-based GUI application for managing an inventory of items. It provides features to add, remove, and view items in a tabular format, making it easy to keep track of stock levels. Below are the key components and functionality:

## Key Features:
1. Graphical User Interface (GUI):
- Uses JFrame and JTable from Swing to create a user-friendly interface.
- A table view to display the list of items with their details (e.g., name, quantity, etc.).
  
2. CRUD Operations:
- Add new items to the inventory through input fields.
- Remove items directly from the table.
- View all inventory items in a real-time table.
  
3. Event Handling:
- Uses ActionListener to handle button clicks (e.g., adding or removing items).
- Interactive components like buttons and forms for seamless interaction.
  
4. Data Management:
- Utilizes an ArrayList to store inventory items.
- The DefaultTableModel is employed to update the JTable dynamically with the latest data.

### Dependencies:
- Java Swing for the graphical interface.
- AWT for basic UI components and event handling.
- DefaultTableModel to manage table data effectively.
